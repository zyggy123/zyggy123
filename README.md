# 👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Hey there! I'm **zyggy123**, a coding enthusiast who's still learning the ropes, but always ready to dive into new projects! 😄

## 🎮 What am I up to?

- 💻 Experimenting with code (I'm still figuring it out, but I try my best).
- 🚀 Jumping into random open-source projects—especially anything related to **AzerothCore** or **TrinityCore**. I’m the guy who likes to stick his nose where it doesn’t belong. 😅
- 🧑‍💻 Not afraid to break things just to see how they work (or don't work). 

## 🤖 AI Enthusiast

I’m super interested in **AI**—whether it’s generating **text**, creating **images**, synthesizing **voices**, or even working with **videos**. I love exploring how AI can push the boundaries of creativity and problem-solving in all these areas. Expect to see me tinkering with AI models and tools whenever I can! 😎

## 🧙‍♂️ WoW Core Modules (Yes, I’m That Guy)

I spend a lot of time poking around **AzerothCore** and **TrinityCore** projects. I might not be a pro, but I love seeing how things tick.

### **AzerothCore**

Trying to improve servers, customize features, and generally get involved where I can. (You might see me around tweaking things.)

### **TrinityCore**

Tinkering with features, creating custom content, and fixing bugs like a true hero.

Other WoW core projects I like to explore:
- **SkyfireCore**: Another popular core for private WoW servers.
- **CMangos**: One of the oldest and most stable WoW server emulators.
- **MangosZero**: For those nostalgic for the classic experience.


### Fan of WoW, especially **Wrath of the Lich King**. 

**For the Horde!** ⚔️
